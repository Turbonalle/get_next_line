ssize_t read(int fd, void *buf, size_t nbyte);

- Reads "n" bytes of data from the object referenced by "fd" into the buffer pointed to by "buf".

- Returns:	- Amount of bytes read,
			- 0 if end of file,
			- -1 if there's an error.

- If read() is called again on the same file:	- it will remember where the "cursor" is,
												- it will overwrite the buf with the next "n" bytes.

Thoughts: - If return size isn't the same as "n", the "cursor" has reached the end of file.
